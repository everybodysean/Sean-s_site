  <p>For if life is a tall tender tree,
    For then, life is joy, life is free.
    The tree is dancing in the air, sunny or showers,
    With his joy, with his love, with his flowers.
    
    For if life is a tall tender tree,
    There is no pain or gain, she or he.
    No complaining, only serving and caring.
    Creating life for joy of sharing.
    
    For if life is a tall tender tree,
    For then, there are no you and me.
    We are nature; we are love; we are beauty.
    Giving and loving is our eternal duty.</p>
